    description: 'In contemporary astronomy, a constellation is one of 88 regions of the sky generally based on the asterisms (which are also called "constellations") of Greek and Roman mythology. The number 88, along with the contemporary scientific concept of "constellation" as regions of the sky, bordered by arcs of right ascensions and declinations, that together cover the entire celestial sphere, was established in 1922 by the International Astronomical Union.'

    description: 'Traditional Chinese astronomy has a system of dividing the celestial sphere into asterisms or constellations, known as "officials". The Chinese asterisms are generally smaller than the constellations of Hellenistic tradition. The Song dynasty (13th-century) Suzhou planisphere shows a total of 283 asterisms, comprising a total of 1,565 individual stars. The asterisms are divided into four groups, the Twenty-Eight Mansions along the ecliptic, and the Three Enclosures of the northern sky. The southern sky was added as a fifth group in the late Ming Dynasty based on European star charts, comprising an additional 23 asterisms.'

    description: 'The combination of two calendars, solar and lunar, allowed the Aztecs to pinpoint the main phases in their economic life. Sun and moon are the two celestial bodies most linked to nature and act(ed) as symbols of those key pairs of opposites so necessary for life - fire and water, light and darkness, the very cycle of life and matter. Solar phases and the completion of a star or constellation’s zenith in the sky marked cycles and ‘coincidences’ celebrated by religious festivals: for example, the moment when the Pleiades reached their zenith signalled the start of a new calendar cycle of 52 years.'

    description: 'Most ancient cultures saw pictures in the stars of the night sky. The earliest known efforts to catalogue the stars date to cuneiform texts and artifacts dating back roughly 6000 years. These remnants, found in the valley of the Euphrates River, suggest that the ancients observing the heavens saw the lion, the bull, and the scorpion in the stars. The constellations as we know them today are undoubtedly very different from those first few--our night sky is a compendium of images from a number of different societies, both ancient and modern. By far, though, we owe the greatest debt to the mythology of the ancient Greeks and Romans.'

    description: 'Egyptian astronomy begins in prehistoric times, in the Predynastic Period. In the 5th millennium BCE, the stone circles at Nabta Playa may have made use of astronomical alignments. By the time the historical Dynastic Period began in the 3rd millennium BCE, the 365-day period of the Egyptian calendar was already in use, and the observation of stars was important in determining the annual flooding of the Nile.'
